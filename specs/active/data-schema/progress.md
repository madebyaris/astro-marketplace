# Progress Log â€” Data Schema Implementation

## 2025-09-26
- Added Astro middleware + helper to inject local D1 binding during `astro dev`; `/api/admin/*` now hits SQLite without extra commands.
- Documented behavior in README (optional `D1_LOCAL_PATH`).
- Feature brief updated with new change log entry.
- TODO: add toggle/logging when DB fallback triggers.

## 2025-09-25
- Added Cloudflare config updates (`astro.config.mjs`, `wrangler.toml`) and README guidance for D1/KV provisioning.
- Built D1 helper utilities (`src/lib/db.ts`) and repository layer for products, categories, settings, pages, and integrations.
- Extended migrations (`0005_admin_extensions.sql`) with new columns/tables for admin content and ensured seed data (`0002_seed.sql`) populates rich product metadata.
- Refactored admin API routes to prefer D1 repositories when binding available while retaining in-memory fallback for local mocks.
- Implemented basic statistics endpoint querying `affiliate_click_logs` with totals, trends, and marketplace distribution.
- Documented outstanding work: need auth/session wiring, comprehensive testing, and UI integration once DB layer replaces mocks entirely.
- Discovery: running `astro dev` leaves `/api/admin/*` on mock store (returns 404 after migrations). Need dev binding strategy (e.g., `wrangler pages dev`).

## Manual Verification
- Ran `wrangler d1 migrations apply astro_marketplace --local` (success). After middleware update, `npm run dev` serves `/api/admin/products` with D1 data (verified via sample request).
